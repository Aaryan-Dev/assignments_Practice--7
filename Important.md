Identify Prime is a good question...there were two solution to that problem by me 
(i) to break; the loop and Print yes or No depending on the condition, while initializing the boolean value as true
(ii) by using boolean method which will be defined by 0 or 1 and then converting it to boolean i.e Boolean(value);
