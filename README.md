For identify Prime there are three solution to the problem by me 

   (i) Nested loop method to find prime numbers
  (ii) To break; the loop and Print yes or No depending on the condition, while initializing the boolean value as true       
 (iii) By using boolean method which will be defined by 0 or 1 and then converting it to boolean i.e Boolean(value);
